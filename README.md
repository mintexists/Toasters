# Toasters

## About
This is a collection of a large variety of toasters in a arbitrary yet numerical order

## Requirements
Requirements:
1. Toasters
2. More Toasters

## Running
To run a toaster, simply plug it in and pull down the lever

## Troubleshooting
If the toast is stuck in the toaster, you can bouce the lever up and down to try to bounce the toast out, or you can use a fork and play the most dangerous form of Operation based around toast

## Notice
